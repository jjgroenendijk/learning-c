# C Programs Repository

Welcome to my repository of small C programs! This repository is a collection of programs that I have written as I learn C programming language. I am using this repository to keep track of my learning progress and to practice using vim and git.

Each program in this repository is a small, self-contained project that is designed to showcase a particular concept or feature of the C language. Some examples of programs that you may find in this repository include:

 *   A simple "Hello, World!" program
 *   A program that calculates the area of a circle
 *   A program that reads and writes data from a file
 *   A program that uses arrays and loops to perform calculations

I hope that this repository will be a useful resource for anyone who is learning C, or who is interested in learning more about programming in general. Thanks for visiting!
